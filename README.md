## 3. Description

### Our Motivation
Our motivation is to give the best experience to students visiting Bilkent, which starts with the application process. We want this experience to attract the brightest minds and show them the greatness of our university.

### Our Goals
We aim to make the application process as smooth and satisfying as possible, allowing schools and students to apply for an appointment to visit Bilkent and be informed about us with ease. Furthermore, we aim to give our communications department a flawless stream of data and ease their job of managing appointments to achieve the highest quality and professionalism possible. 


### Problems our project aims to address
There are two main problems the web app will address, the unorganized appointment-making process and poor quality data captured from school and students. The web app will help sort out the appointment-making process to be clearer, more manageable, and more professional, creating an attractive introduction to our university. Furthermore, the web app will provide the communications department with clearer and more usable data that will allow them to target students and schools better and increase the number of high-performing students coming to Bilkent from all around the country.

### Features

Our project is designed with two distinct user roles: **Visitors** (such as high school counselors, students, etc.) and **Bilkent Staff**. Each user type has access to specific features that cater to their needs.

We will implement a robust authentication system using email and password login, ensuring a secure experience for all users. Below is a breakdown of the key features for both user groups:

---

#### Visitor Features (High School Counselors, Students, etc.)

Visitors will have access to the following core functionalities:

- **Appointment Management**:  
  Visitors can view both their past and upcoming appointments in an intuitive **calendar format**, making it easy to track and manage their schedules.
- **Create an Appointment**:  
  Easily schedule a tour or meeting with Bilkent staff through a streamlined booking process.

- **About Bilkent**:  
  A dedicated section where visitors can learn more about Bilkent University, its programs, and campus life. This will serve as a resource to improve engagement and understanding of what the university offers.

- **Settings**:  
  Basic account management options, where users can view and update their personal information, such as email, password, and preferences.

- **Feedback**:  
  After completing a tour or appointment, visitors will be prompted to leave feedback about their experience. This feature aims to gather insights to improve the campus tours and visitor experience.

#### Admin Features (Bilkent Staff)

Bilkent staff, such as administrators and tour guides, will have access to a comprehensive **dashboard** to manage appointments, review visitor data, and track feedback.

- **Requests Management**:  
  Admins can view and manage tour or appointment requests, with options to **accept** or **cancel** pending appointments.

- **Data Visualization**:  
  Insightful charts and graphs displaying key statistics, such as the number of students from different high schools. This will help Bilkent staff make data-driven decisions and understand visitor demographics.

- **Visitor Feedback**:  
  Bilkent staff and guides can access feedback left by visitors, enabling them to address any concerns or improve the overall visitor experience.

These features will ensure a seamless experience for both visitors and Bilkent staff, enhancing communication, efficiency, and overall satisfaction.
